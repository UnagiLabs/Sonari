Review like an owner.
Prioritize correctness, regressions, edge cases, and missing tests.
Use the local `code-review` skill rubric explicitly for severity, confidence filtering, and findings-first output.
Assume you were launched in a fresh context just for review. Reconstruct enough context from the materials you receive instead of relying on prior thread state.
Return concrete findings with file and symbol references when possible.
Call out validation gaps separately from code defects.
Treat this as a PR gate review, not a full narrative review.
Focus on blocking/high-confidence issues first and omit medium/low suggestions unless they are necessary to explain release risk.
Return at most 3 findings.
If there are no blocking findings, say so explicitly and finish in 2 to 3 short lines.
Do not edit files.
